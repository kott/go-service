# go-service
Outline of a simple HTTP service in Go

I'll be using the [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework for the bones of this REST API. The purpose is to create
a starting point for any HTTP service such that the dockerization, configuration and general service layout is predefined.
This will hopefully make it easier to get started or at least be a good example of what a service using the echo framework
might look like.

## Getting Started
Not much for now, but might become more involved as we go along.
* Install dependencies: `go get -u ./...`
* Run the service: `docker-compose up --build`
